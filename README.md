# Data Augmentation for Text Classification Tasks

Except from the thesis: "Each experiment... consist[s] of an augmentation technique being used for an application method, to assist a classification model’s performance on a dataset. For example, backtranslation, used to rebalance an imbalanced dataset, will assist an RNN’s performance on the Subj dataset."

Augmentation Method:
 - Synonym replacement
 - Backtranslation
 - Contextual augmentation with BERT

Classification models:
 - RNN
 - BERT

Datasets:
 - SST
 - Subj
 - SFU

Settings:
 - Imbalanced training set
 - Varying percentage of training set
